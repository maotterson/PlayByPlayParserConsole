# Play-by-Play  (from PFReference) Details

Based on verbiage within the detail category of a play, contents such as involved player names, yardage gained, direction, etc. can be extracted and instantiated into different play types. Sentences are structured consistently once type is determined, but there are idiosyncrasies between different types. Examples of the different types are demonstrated below:
